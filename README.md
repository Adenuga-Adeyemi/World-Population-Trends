###World Population Trends
I’m excited to share the results of my first task as part of my internship program Prodigy InfoTech. The focus was on analyzing the global population trends across the years 2020–2023 and providing insightful visualizations and recommendations.

Data Source: Worldometer
Tools: Excel, DAX, PowerBI

🎯 Objectives
The objective of this task was to provide a comprehensive Population Overview based on time (years) and key segments, using interactive dashboards to:
1️⃣ Visualize total population trends (2020–2023).
2️⃣ Analyze Top 10 Countries and their contribution to the total population.
3️⃣ Examine population distribution in income groups and regions.

🔍 Analysis Highlights
📊 Total Population by Year:
2020: 81bn (24.64%)
2021: 82bn (24.89%)
2022: 83bn (25.11%)
2023: 83bn (25.36%)

📈 Key Trends:
World Average Population stands at 13.51bn, with significant contributions from IDA & IBRD regions. Top Countries like Vietnam, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela showcase varying growth rates, while global trends stabilize across years.
✅ Recommendations
To justify and sustain population growth:
1️⃣ Prioritize middle-income regions with higher growth rates for infrastructure and social services.
2️⃣ Develop population strategies for high-contributing countries to manage sustainability.
3️⃣ Address gaps in lower and upper-middle-income regions through targeted programs.
