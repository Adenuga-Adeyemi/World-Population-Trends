# World Population Trends
I‚Äôm excited to share the results of my first task as part of my internship program Prodigy InfoTech. The focus was on analyzing the global population trends across the years 2020‚Äì2023 and providing insightful visualizations and recommendations.

## Data Source: Worldometer
Tools: Excel, DAX, PowerBI

## Objectives
The objective of this task was to provide a comprehensive Population Overview based on time (years) and key segments, using interactive dashboards to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Visualize total population trends (2020‚Äì2023).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Top 10 Countries and their contribution to the total population.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Examine population distribution in income groups and regions.

## Analysis Highlights
üìä Total Population by Year:
2020: 81bn (24.64%)
2021: 82bn (24.89%)
2022: 83bn (25.11%)
2023: 83bn (25.36%)

## Key Trends:
World Average Population stands at 13.51bn, with significant contributions from IDA & IBRD regions. Top Countries like Vietnam, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela showcase varying growth rates, while global trends stabilize across years.

## Recommendations
To justify and sustain population growth:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritize middle-income regions with higher growth rates for infrastructure and social services.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Develop population strategies for high-contributing countries to manage sustainability.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Address gaps in lower and upper-middle-income regions through targeted programs.
